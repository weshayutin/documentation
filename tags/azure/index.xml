Out of the box, the ARO service mirrors all the code repositories to build OpenShift clusters to Azure Container Registry. This means ARO is built without having to reach out to the Internet as the images to build OpenShift are pulled via the Azure private network.
When you upgrade a cluster, OpenShift needs to call out to the Internet to get an upgrade graph to see what options you have to upgrade the cluster.</description></item><item><title>Helm Chart to set up extra MachineSets on ARO clusters</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/aro-machinesets/readme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/aro-machinesets/readme/</guid><description>Please refer to the The Managed OpenShift Black Belt team maintained Helm chart at here .</description></item><item><title>Integrating Azure ARC with ARO</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-arc-integration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-arc-integration/</guid><description>This document explain how to integrate ARO cluster with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

Prerequisites An ARO cluster The AZ CLI (logged in) The OC CLI (logged in) Helm 3.x CLI Environment Variables Run this command to set some environment variables to use throughout
Note if you created the cluster from the instructions linked above these will re-use the same environment variables, or default them to openshift and eastus.</description></item><item><title>Shipping logs to Azure Log Analytics</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/o11y/az-log-analytics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/o11y/az-log-analytics/</guid><description>This document follows the steps outlined by Microsoft in their documentation Follow docs.
Step 4, needs additional command of:
az resource list --resource-type Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift/OpenShiftClusters -o json to capture resource ID of ARO cluster as well, needed for export in step 6
bash enable-monitoring.sh --resource-id $azureAroV4ClusterResourceId --workspace-id $logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId works successfully

It is not a detailed design, but rather a starting point for a more detailed design.
What is Disaster Recovery (DR) Disaster Recovery is an umbrella term that includes the following:
Backup (and restore!) Failover (and failback!) High Availability Disaster Avoidence The most important part of Disaster Recovery is the &amp;ldquo;Recovery&amp;rdquo;. Whatever your DR plan it must be tested and ideally performed on a semi-regular basis.</description></item><item><title>Private ARO Cluster with access via JumpHost</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/private-cluster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/private-cluster/</guid><description>A Quickstart guide to deploying a Private Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
Once the cluster is running you will need a way to access the private network that ARO is deployed into.

However its not unreasonable to expect that metrics should be persisted for a set amount of time.
This guide shows how to set up Thanos to federate both System and User Workload Metrics to a Thanos gateway that stores the metrics in Azure Files and makes them available via a Grafana instance (managed by the Grafana Operator).</description></item><item><title>Installing Astronomer on a private ARO cluster</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/astronomer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/astronomer/</guid><description>see here for public clusters.
This assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve already got a private ARO cluster installed. You could also follow the same instructions to create a public Astronomer, just use a regular DNS zone and skip the private parts.
A default 3-node cluster is a bit small for Astronomer, If you have a three node cluster you can increase it by updating the replicas count machinesets in the openshift-machine-api namespace.</description></item></channel></rss>
