Be aware of the security implications of creating a public subnet in your ROSA VPC this way.
Refer to the blog &amp;amp;ldquo;How to add public Ingress to a PrivateLink ROSA cluster&amp;amp;rdquo; , to expose applications to the internet by deploying in a PrivateLink Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) cluster within a truly private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that doesnâ€™t have an internet gateway attached to it.</description></item><item><title>Creating a ROSA cluster with Private Link enabled (custom VPC) and STS</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/sts-with-private-link/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/sts-with-private-link/</guid><description>This is a combination of the private-link and sts setup documents to show the full picture
Prerequisites AWS CLI Rosa CLI v1.1.7 jq AWS Preparation If this is a brand new AWS account that has never had a AWS Load Balancer installed in it, you should run the following
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name \ &amp;#34;elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com&amp;#34; Create the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Subnets For this scenario, we will be using a newly created VPC with both public and private subnets.</description></item><item><title>Creating a ROSA cluster with Private Link enabled</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/private-link/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/private-link/</guid><description>Prerequisites AWS CLI Rosa CLI v1.0.8 jq Create VPC and Subnets The following instructions use the AWS CLI to create the necessary networking to deploy a Private Link ROSA cluster into a Single AZ and are intended to be a guide.
