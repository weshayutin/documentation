When you create a cluster on ARO you have several options in making the cluster public or private. With a public cluster you are allowing Internet traffic to the api and *.apps endpoints. With a private cluster you can make either or both the api and .apps endpoints private.
How can you allow Internet access to an application running on your private cluster where the .</description></item><item><title>Setup a VPN Connection into an ARO Cluster with OpenVPN</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/vpn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/vpn/</guid><description>When you configure an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster with a private only configuration, you will need connectivity to this private network in order to access your cluster.

One of the advantages of using OpenShift is the internal registry that comes with OpenShfit to build, deploy and manage container images locally. By default, access to the registry is limited to the cluster ( by design ) but can be extended to usage outside of the cluster. This guide will go through the steps required to access the OpenShift Registry on an ARO cluster outside of the cluster.</description></item><item><title>Configure ARO with OpenShift Data Foundation</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/odf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/odf/</guid><description>Kevin Collins

You can limit access to the ACR by assigning virtual network private IP addresses to the registry endpoints and using Azure Private Link .

Out of the box, the ARO service mirrors all the code repositories to build OpenShift clusters to Azure Container Registry. This means ARO is built without having to reach out to the Internet as the images to build OpenShift are pulled via the Azure private network.
When you upgrade a cluster, OpenShift needs to call out to the Internet to get an upgrade graph to see what options you have to upgrade the cluster.</description></item><item><title>Helm Chart to set up extra MachineSets on ARO clusters</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/aro-machinesets/readme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/aro-machinesets/readme/</guid><description>Please refer to the The Managed OpenShift Black Belt team maintained Helm chart at here .</description></item><item><title>Integrating Azure ARC with ARO</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-arc-integration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-arc-integration/</guid><description>This document explain how to integrate ARO cluster with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

By default, the public IP address assigned to an OpenShift service with a type of LoadBalancer created by an ARO cluster is only valid for the lifespan of that resource. If you delete the OpenShift service, the associated load balancer and IP address are also deleted. If you want to assign a specific IP address or retain an IP address for redeployed OpenShift services, you can create and use a static public IP address.</description></item><item><title>Adding infrastructure nodes to an ARO cluster</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/add-infra-nodes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/add-infra-nodes/</guid><description>This document shows how to set up infrastructure nodes in an ARO cluster and move infrastructure related workloads to them.
