It will also also configure the ARO cluster to use the SSO server as a mechanism to login by way of the OIDC protocol. In addition, Red Hat SSO can federate user identities with other identity providers. We will use Azure AD as an additional identity provider to show how this could be done.</description></item><item><title>What to consider when using Azure AD as IDP?</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/considerations-aad-ipd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 18:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/considerations-aad-ipd/</guid><description>Author: Ricardo Macedo Martins May 24, 2023
In this guide, we will discuss key considerations when using Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the Identity Provider (IDP) for your ARO or ROSA cluster. Below are some helpful references:
Configure ARO to Use Azure AD Configuring IDP for ROSA, OSD, and ARO Default Access for All Users in Azure Active Directory Once you set up AAD as the IDP for your cluster, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that by default, all users in your Azure Active Directory instance will have access to the cluster.</description></item><item><title>Configure Azure AD as an OIDC identity provider for ARO with cli</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/azuread-aro-cli/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/azuread-aro-cli/</guid><description>The steps to add Azure AD as an identity provider for Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) via cli are:

This guide focuses on how to synchronize Identity Provider (IDP) groups and users after configuring authentication in OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM). For an IDP configuration example, please reference the Configure Okta as an OIDC identity provider for ROSA/OSD guide.
To set up group synchronization from Okta to ROSA/OSD you must:
Define groups and assign users in Okta Install the Group Sync Operator from the OpenShift Operator Hub Create and configure a new Group Sync instance Set a synchronization schedule Test the synchronization process Define groups and assign users in Okta To synchronize groups and users with ROSA/OSD they must exist in Okta</description></item><item><title>Configure GitLab as an identity provider for ARO</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/gitlab-aro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/gitlab-aro/</guid><description>The following instructions will detail how to configure GitLab as the identity provider for Azure Red Hat OpenShift:
